                    <p>Hi, I'm Minseok Choi. I'm from South Korea. If you feel difficult in calling my name, just call me Mr. Choi. <br><br>
                        I was born in Seoul, the capitial city of South Korea. I majored in Mechanical Engineering, and I had a ph.D degree in Mechanical Engineering because I liked my major. <br><br>
                        During ph.D and after ph.D, I mainly had tasks of making a certain program (Molecular Dynamics) using computer language cording. For this reason, during the work, I had to study making logical codes, and I also liked doing it as well. I studied a few computer languages such as Fortran, C language, and Java. <br><br> 
                        And also I had an experience making laboratory homepages connecting with Oracle Database using JSP. This experience is a quite fun for me. I really want to study more about that, so I moved alone to Ausin in Texas and I resistered for UT bootcamp, and now I'm studying it in bootcamp. <br><br>
                        I'm not good at English, so sometimes I can misunderstand what you're saying. If I didn't understand your meaning, it would be appreciate if you speak a little slowly.<br><br>
                        <strong>My Dream : I really want to get an IT job in Texas, please help me!!!!!</strong>
